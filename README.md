**GOSNIFF** is a TUI-based, *tcpdump*-inspired tool used to provide some graphical insight into networking on your computer. 

Currently, it supports
[Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) syntax](https://biot.com/capstats/bpf.html), identical to filtering syntax in tools like Wireshark or, y'know, tcpdump.
